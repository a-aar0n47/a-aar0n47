# About Me!
## 👋I’m @a-aar0n47
My actual name is Aaron Musisi, and I'm an aspiring full-stack software engineer.
<br>
 I want to develop full-stack applications using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C++ and other languages I will learn.
 I'm still learning the basics so I stay away from frameworks💀
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects using HTML and CSS, JS, Pyhton and C++.
 Still trying to grasp some concepts about the fundamentals and GitHub too😁<br>
